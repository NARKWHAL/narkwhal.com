## Whois
Gives information around a website. Comes with Kali by default

## Subfinder
Finds subdomains of target website

## Asset Finder
Should be installed with pimp my Kali. similar to subfinder but also looks for some assets tied to the target sight. Remember to check scope of work.

## Amass
Great tool but can take a long time. it is very robust though

## httprobe 


## gowitness
Goes out and takes pictures of domains.
