## Summary
A  few months ago I was thinking about going back to college. More specifically I was thinking about going to WGU for Cyber Security. Having no degree but already being in tech I thought it 

The order in which I will be taking them is based on a few factors.

1) **Difficulty** - based on resources I found online I am going to try to front load the challenge with the most cost affective beginner level certifications incase at any point I realize this is not a path I want to pursue.
2) **Cost** - The more expensive ones, even if considered less difficult by many, might be pushed further out just to increase the odds of passing it in the smaller time frame given.
3) **Relevance** - A few certifications at different times might be considered more low level then the ones around it. The reason this is done is because knowledge obtained by the more Jr certification may be lost if done in the begining by the time you take a more senior one.
4) **Spaced Repetition** - TERC is not just about Pen Testing. Its also about Bug Bounty, web application exploitation, malware, etc. I feel like splitting some of these certifications out of a linear order will help make sure the data is retained longer.

**Certifications could be added or remove at any point. Some new certifications might be made that woulod be a good fit somewhere or a cert issuer might decide to stop making their certifications never expire.
