I am not sure what is going on when I use fuff but I am getting some weird results and the only answer I can find is it is my terminal's window size.

For example I am running the command from yesterday

```bash
ffuf -u 'http://localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=FUZZ' -w numbers.txt -mr 'admin'
```

what I get from the terminal when I have a large surface is the following:

What I get when I have a small surface is the following:

I am not sure what is causing this but its weird and annoying that I can get what I am not looking for from my terminal window simply not being the right size?
