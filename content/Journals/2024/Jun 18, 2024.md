## Raw Notes
- Installed Foxy Proxy yesterday didn't take notes because it did not seem necessary
- So far this is information I have already learned about the Proxy on Burp Suite
- Burp Suite
	- Proxy
		- see data flowing from client to server
	- Intruder
		- brute forcing
		- Install the extension Turbo Intruder?
		- Logger++ should be installed apparently
- Authentication
	- The authentication "flow" is a common attack vector
	- What is the difference between authentication and authorization(access control)
		- Authentication 
			- is your Identity
		- Authorization access control
			- Is what you are allowed to do
	- The two main ways we are going to attack Authorization are
		- Brute force attacks
			- Dev teams under estimate
		- Logic issues
			- usually critical and undetected by tools
- Critical Thinking Podcast
	- Bug Bounty Hunting is a game of luck but you control how many times you roll the dice.
	- Go down rabbit holes but possibly control yourself when doing them. When starting out it is good to go down rabbit holes because you are also learning.
	- Take your time with a program. The first 40 hours you spend on a program is to learn about the program before getting any attack vectors
	- Fuzz all the things
	- Dedicate time everyday
	- Dedicate time to learn new attacks
