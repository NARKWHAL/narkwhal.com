## Journalling
So I don't pass the PJOR certification. I do not need to wait for results since I only submitted thirty points worth of the exam. I am going to hold off re taking it and focus down the road of the other certifications I want to take that are more technical. After a bit more research into order of which to take certifications I might change some things up. Regardless though the PJPT and PJWT are the first up in the wave of certifications to get done.

Decided to start with the #PJPT certification based on recommendations from other people. Since the certification is also a bulk of the PNPT course I am wondering If I want to switch the learning path or keep hop scotching between Pen Testing and web app security.

## Daily learning recap

- Being a Penetration Tester has three major aspects to the job
	- Assessments
		- What everyone thinks of when it comes to pentesting. This is where you are doing the hacking.
	- Report Writing
		- Sharing the discoveries of you findings and how to remedy them in written form.
	- Debriefing
		- Sharing your report in a meeting aspect.
- The first report you write is a draft
	- I found this part interesting. I assume a customer can come back stating something is not accurate or critical. Maybe getting security certified these reports have to be shared and can shine the company in a bad light? I want to know more about this
- There are a bunch of different types of assessments
	- External - Where you are trying to get into the organizations network from the inside
	- Internal - Where you are trying to see what you can do once you are inside the organizations network
	- Web Application - Where you are assessing an organizations web application
	- Wireless Network - Seeing if you can hack into an organizations internet
	- Physical - physically be able to get into an organizations restricted areas.
- Report writing Typically needs to be delivered within a week of the pentest
	- Has to be high level and technical

## What I need to learn more of #todo

1) OSI Model - Possibly make flash cards of this since I have learned it a few times and do not remember it. Possibly find a more in depth video on the OSI model or networking.
2) Possibly just learn more IT stuff including IP Address stuff


## Raw Notes

- What is the difference between internal and external penetration tests?
	- Internal: This is assessing the organizations security from inside the network. 
		- Relies heavily on Active Directory
		- last 32-40 hours with an additional 8-16 report writing
	- **External**: an [[external pentest]] are more straight forward and are essentially trying to do the pentest from outside the org and its network. Use #OSINT to gather information. These are the most common engagement because a lot of security compliance require an external pentest yearly. 
		- Typically lasts 32-40 hours with another 8-6 for report writing.
- Web Application Pentest
	- Second most common pentest
	- Asses the organizations web application security
	- Focuses heavily on web-baed attacks and the OWASP testing guidelines
	- Typically lasts 32-40 hours with another 8-16 hours for report writing.
- Wireless Network Pentest
	- Assessing an organizations wireless network security
	- methodology changes based on guest vs WPA2-PSK vs WPA2 Enterprise
	- Need a wireless adapter
	- Typically lasts 4-8 hours per SSID and another 2 -4 hours of report writing
- Physical Pentest & Social engineering
	- Assesing an organizations physical security
	- Methodology depends on task and goals
	- Typically lasts 16-40 hours with another 4-8 for report writing
	- can last 16-40 hours or 4-8 hours
- other assessments
	- Mobile pentesting
	- IoT Pentesting
	- Red Team Engagements
		- Stealth and long lasting
	- Purple Team Engagements
		- blue and red team working together to harden security
- Report Writing
	- typically delivered within a week after the engagement
		- High level summary for non technical folks
		- Technical recommendations that also include remediation should be clear to both execs and technical folks
- Debrief 
	- Walk through your report doing non technical and technical for both types of people on the call
	- The debrief gives the customer the ability to ask questions and address any concerns before a final report is released. 
	- The original report is a draft.
- Why not to get into this career?
	- For the money
		- It is good pay but is work
	- Some one who does not like to study
		- Do not like being complacent
	- You are not passionate about the field
- IP Addresses
	- communicate over layer 3
	- Learn the OSI Model #todo 
	- NAT - Network address translation
	- Private IP addresses are in 4 claSSES

	- Might want to look into learning the gist of networking better.
