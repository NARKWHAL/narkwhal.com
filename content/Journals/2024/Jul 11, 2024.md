## Raw Notes
Docker
	- Containers share kernals
	- Cant run windows on a Linux host via Docker due to kernal
	- Docker Commands
		- Commands
			- ```docker ps``` -> Shows all running containers
			- ```docker ps -a```-> Shows all running and stopped containers
			- ```docker stop <container name or id>```
			- ```docker rm``` -> Removes a container permanently but keeps the image
			- ```docker images``` Show all docker images
			- ```docker rmi <image name>``` remove docker image
			- ```docker pull <image name>``` pulls the docker image from the hub
			- ```docker run ubuntu sleep 5``` -> runs a container and gives it the command to sleep for 5 seconds
			- ```docker exec <container name> <command>``` -> will make a currently running container execute a command
		- Attached vs Detached
			- Attached means your console is now the console of the container
			- Detached means its running self contained and your console is your underlining console.
			- ```docker run``` -> Will make you default attached
			- ```docker run -d``` -> will let you run detached
			- ```docker attach <container id>```-> Allows you to attach to a currently running container.
		- Command
			- ```docker run -d --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine``` -> Run a detached container based on the nginx alpine container and name it webapp
