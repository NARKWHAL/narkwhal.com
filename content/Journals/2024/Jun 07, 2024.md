## Summary

Today was a wild day. Very little sleep, very stressful, and having only 30/100 points complete for the PJOR certification I don't know if I have any energy in me to keep working on it tonight and I don't feel right having my wife watch all three of our kids tomorrow while I hope to pass by spending all day trying to get those 80 points. 

I am wondering if I want to put the PJOR certification on hold and focus on the more technical challenges right now first just so my technical chops stay up to snuff. It will also give me more opportunities with the automation OSINT that i need to get better at.

I am going to sleep on all of this though since this just might be a mood from the three hours of sleep I got last night.

However, I did come up with the order that I think I want to make the certifications and the idea I have for it. I will call it [[App Sec School]] feel free to go over there and take a look.
