## Summary
Needed sleep really bad so I had to skip my normal learning for the day. I think I am going to Split my training with PJPT and CKA

## Learning recap
I am going to split my training between CKA and PJWT. AppSec is the part that interests me the most and the one I will be the most familiar with I will still go the PJPT route but I think I need to stop by my friends in Networking first.

Got lab set up for PJWT

## Raw Notes

### CKA - Linux - Security
- Access Control
	- Accounts
		- every user has an account
		- username and password
		- UID - unique ID
		- Information about the user is stored in /etc/passwd
			- Its you again
		- groups have the GID
		- users can be part of multiple groups
		- 'id' command tells you the id and group info
		- root is id 0
		- system accounts are usually group 100 or between 500-1000 id and generally do not have a root folder
		- There are 4 types of accounts
			- User Account
			- Superuser Account
				- Root id 0 - unrestricted access
			- System Accounts
				- created during OS installation
				- services that will not run under super user
				- dont have a dedicated home directory and if so it wont be in the /home directory
			- Service Accounts
				- nginx
		- Useful commands
			- 'id
				- Gives UID and GID and group ID
			- 'who'
				- list of users currently logged into system
			- 'last'
				- displays the record of all loggen in users as well as date and time of last reboot
		- Switching users
			- su - 
			- sudo
				- /etc/sudoers
					- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 8.47.44 PM 1.png]]
					- The people that have access to using sudo
					- Setting a no login shell for root user will block people logging in as root
		- Access Control Files
			- /etc/passwd
				- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 8.50.44 PM.png]]
				- passwords are not stored here
				- GECOS is a comma seperated list of inforation
				- HOMEDIR is their home directory
				- SHELL is the default shell
			- /etc/shadow
				- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 8.52.30 PM.png]]
				- These are the passwords in hash
				- MINAGE - min days user has to wait to change password
				- MAXAGE - max amount of days until a user has to change password
				- WARN - Number of days before a password expires they should be warned
				- INACTIVE - number of days after a password expires until the password no longer works
				- EXPDATE - Amount of days until the account expires.
			- /etc/group
				- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 8.58.30 PM 1.png]]
		- Managing Users
			- commands
				- useradd
					- makes a new user
					- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 9.01.11 PM.png]]
				- passwd
					- sets a password for the user
				- userdel 
					- deletes user
				- groupadd 
					- add group
					- -g custom gid
				- groupdel
					- delete group
	- Linux File Permissions
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 9.17.53 PM.png]]
		- CHMOD
			- changes the permissions of a file
		- chown
			- change owner and group
			- chown user:group test-file
			- chown user test-file
		- chgrp
			- changes only the group ownership of the file
			- chgrp group test-file
		- ls -ld /directory/path
			- See permissions of a directory
	- ssh-copy-id
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 9.46.36 PM.png]]
	- SCP
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 10.00.45 PM.png]]
		- SCP allows you to send files through SSH
	- IP Tables
		- Red Hat and Centos its already installed
		- has a chain of rules based on conditions
			- input rule... you are high if you think I am going to remember this
			- ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 10.19.45 PM.png]]
			- iptables command is a real hoot
			- I think this is just going to to be something I will have to stack overflow whenever I need it.
		- CROTAB
			- Need to dive into this more
			- if I ever need it

## PJPT
- Common Network Commands
	- ip a
		- new way of getting ip data
	- ifconfig
		- old way of getting ip data
		- Only shows hard connections (ethernet)
	- iwconfig
		- Shows wireless connections
	- ip n
		- ip neighbor
		- arp -a is the old school equivalent
		- Need to study up on networking I do not know arp
- GOING TO STOP STUDYING FOR PJPT UNTIL I LEARN MORE NETWORKING
	- A bunch of networking terms are getting brought up so I am going to put PJWT on pause and start PJWT

## PJWT
- Just going to get my lab environment set up. For some reason when I did it the first time it never wanted to boot up after upgrades. I am wondering if this is because of the networking stuff I added for the PJPT? Doubt it. When in doubt I generally just burn it with fire. missed a learning opportunity here but I am a little tired and lazy.
- I was tired I shouldn't have nuked it. I solved it. a little too late
