## Summary
The PJOR certification is much harder then I thought it would be based on the training. Last night when I started it I went in with the thought I would complete it in a few hours but ended up only getting a fraction of it complete. 

I felt completely and utterly out of my element to complete this certification and it didn't matter that I had 72 hours to complete I could only figure out one of the easy questions.

Today though I solved one in less then five minutes from the bathroom and a few other challenges came to me at random parts of the day while I was doing something else. 

I am still not done. Do I think I will pass with less then 48 hours left and still a full work day in front of me? Probably not but I am not giving up.


## Daily Goals

- [x] Keep working on PJOR challenge
