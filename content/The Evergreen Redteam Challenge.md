## Summary
The Evergreen Redteam Challenge, or what I am typing as #TERC from here on out, is a challenge I am going to take to get a bunch of offensive cyber security certifications that do not expire (Evergreen).

The order in which I will be taking them is based on a few factors.

1) **Difficulty** - based on resources I found online I am going to try to front load the challenge with the most cost affective beginner level certifications incase at any point I realize this is not a path I want to pursue.
2) **Cost** - The more expensive ones, even if considered less difficult by many, might be pushed further out just to increase the odds of passing it in the smaller time frame given.
3) **Relevance** - A few certifications at different times might be considered more low level then the ones around it. The reason this is done is because knowledge obtained by the more Jr certification may be lost if done in the begining by the time you take a more senior one.
4) **Spaced Repetition** - TERC is not just about Pen Testing. Its also about Bug Bounty, web application exploitation, malware, etc. I feel like splitting some of these certifications out of a linear order will help make sure the data is retained longer.

**Certifications could be added or remove at any point. Some new certifications might be made that woulod be a good fit somewhere or a cert issuer might decide to stop making their certifications never expire. 

## Phase 1: Beginner - $498

The first phase of the challenge are two certifications considered by many as a great entry level knowledge of offensive security and will make you instantly scratch that itch of feeling like a hacker. They also have their tests based more off real life where instead of collecting CTFs (Capture the flags... essentially little tokens to prove you did something.... Hacker scout badges) you will be writing reports based on your findings as your deliverables. Also these certifications come with a free retake which will be a great buffer if you were not fully prepared.

1) [TCM Security - Practical Junior Web Tester (PJWT) - $249](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjwt/)
		This certification and the training provided with it will give the student an associate level of knowledge around web application exploitation / basic knowledge around bug bounty hunting incase you want to explore that as a side hustle to pay for all these certifications since Intigriti teamed up with TCM Security for this certification.
		
2) [TCM Security - Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) - $249](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/)
		This certification will be the students introduction to Active Directory and network penetration testing. 

## Phase 2: Advanced Beginner  - $980

This phase is all about taking the training wheels off from the videos of the last phase and forcing you to do challenges that will reinforce the information you learned from the last two certifications. These certifications will be a little more gamified though since they are CTF based.

1) [HTB - Certified Bug Bounty Hunter (HTB-CBBH) - 490](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-bug-bounty-hunter)
		Like how TCM and Intigriti teamed up to train you to smash bugs, so too did Hack The Box and Hacker One to bring you a certification that will make you smash bugs faster then Dale Gribble.
1) [HTB - Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB-CPTS) - 490](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist)
		I mean I do not know what else to say here other than you are going to play with Active directory again. Also I havent taken any of these yet so I do not know why I am providing a summary.

## Phase 3: Entry Level Professional - $998  or $1,247

By the end of this phase you should be able to go out there and become the penetration tester you were dreaming of when starting TERC if you were not already. This phase is a little bit different since its the only phase that has an optional certification, a little certy treat if you will. Also, the first certification to take in this phase is not even out yet at the time of me writing this.

1) TCM - Professional Web Penetration Tester (PWPT) - $499? #todo
		I have nothing to say to this since I have nothing to link it to yet. We have only a hint that its the web version of the PNPT. Maybe they teamed up with Bugcrowd so they don't feel left out?
1) [TCM - Practical Junior OSINT Researcher (PJOR) - $249*](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjor/)
		This one is the optional certification. The OSINT class is used in the PNPT curriculum probably to make you prepared for any research on getting credentials from target employees or physical pen testing . I actually started this training and I am writing this whole post instead of doing the certification challenge.
1) [TCM - Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) - $499](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/)
		Guess what? Active Directory. If I was on the Active Directory development team I would start taking this personally. This training follows the TCM fashion of writing a report but ads in a call to explain your results to someone at TCM as if they were a customer.

## Phase 4: Make recruiters want you and HR approve you

I am sure you saw this coming by now. Its time to go pay Offsec certifications a visit. Now that you have gone through the more reasonably priced certifications it is now time to go get the ones the suits want you to get.

1) [Offsec - Offsec Web Assessor (OSWA) - $1,649](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-200/)
		I mean we came this far with the web testing. No reason not to get this guy as well.
2) [Offsec - Offsec Certified Professional (OSCP) - $1,649](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/)
		Active Directory but now $1,649.
