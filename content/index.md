### This is my [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) mostly around tech and other things of interest.

Chances are if you are here then you are probably me going over my notes or a possible employer I sent the link too since this is my personal site.

## Tech Goals

### Summary
A few people online have told me the idea of getting all of these certifications is a waste of time. I see it though as going to college for it but much cheaper. Instead of just learning theory with some hands on labs in classes I have chose only certifications that are hands on and progressively get harder or more expensive.

The reason I chose TCM certifications first is that they have videos and you get a free retake with each attempt. This method is great for people that are new to the methods.

HTB goes second since they take the training wheels off quite a bit more. Their modules can be a bit vague and their knowledge testing quit a bit harder than TCM.

Offsec is last mostly because of the ***HORRENDOUS*** cost of their certifications and I want to be well prepared for them if I am going to have to pay ðŸ¤¢ ***$1,600 a certification attempt*** ðŸ¤®
