title: Hello, I am Alex Costa
---

### This is my [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) mostly around tech and other things of interest.

I have been in tech now for eight years mostly in customer facing technical roles. 

I am currently working on my [[PJWT]] certification from a heightened interest on application pen testing lately.

That is all I really have to say about myself right now.
