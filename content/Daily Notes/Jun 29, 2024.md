## Raw Notes

- Today I am playing around with Node.js to play around with Grafana

	- If you are importing your own module in Node.js you have to use a ./ or /
		```javascript
		const http = require('http');		
		```

Node does not require much to spin up a web application server in fact this amount of code is all you really need

```javascript
//require the HTTP Server
const http = require('http');

// Build the server and have it log on sonsole the request coming in
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	console.log(req)
});

// Keep the server listening on port 3000 on localhost
server.listen(3000);
```

I am assuming the more I dive into these tutorials we just grab the request ... manipulate or pipe it to the appropriate methods then serve it via res (response).

The Node event loop is a single thread loop.

```javascript
process.exit();
```

The above is a hard exit

The below is a really gross way to get an actual response body. It shows how Node.js serves data thought I guess

```Javascript
//require the HTTP Server
const http = require('http'); 

// Build the server and have it log on sonsole the request coming in
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {

	// Console log the request URL, the request method, and the request headers
	console.log(req.url, req.method, req.headers)

	// Really gross way to inject an HTML response
	// Setting the header tells the client that they are about to recieve HTML
	res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');

	// The write method allows you to append body of the rresponse data
	res.write('<html>');
	res.write('<head><title>Web Page</title></head>');
	res.write('<body><h1>TOOODOOOLOOOO</h1></body>');
	res.write('</html>');

	//Informs the client there is no more data from the response. We are done
	res.end();

});

  

// Keep the server listening on port 3000 on localhost

server.listen(3000);
```
