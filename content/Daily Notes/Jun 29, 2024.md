## Raw Notes

- Today I am playing around with Node.js to play around with Grafana

	- If you are importing your own module in Node.js you have to use a ./ or /
		```javascript
		const http = require('http');		
		```

Node does not require much to spin up a web application server in fact this amount of code is all you really need

```javascript
//require the HTTP Server
const http = require('http');

// Build the server and have it log on sonsole the request coming in
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	console.log(req)
});

// Keep the server listening on port 3000 on localhost
server.listen(3000);
```

I am assuming the more I dive into these tutorials we just grab the request ... manipulate or pipe it to the apporriate methods then serve it via res (response)
