## Journal

I should probably go threw all my notes and start adding them to permenent locations. Maybe make this a weekly task on Sundays to go through that weeks notes and store them in a permanent location.

Not a bad idea but this week I will have to do it with all of my notes

Anyways, I am still going through the Intro to AppSec course on Codebashing from OWASP

Thinking of slowing down my learning a bit and getting three certifications this year instead of trying to gun for it.  maybe get PJWT BBH and Burpsuite as well as Javascript and Python learning

In all honestly I should probably just stick to something instead of bouncing all over the place.

## Raw Notes

- Popular modeling methods are 
	- PASTA
	- STRIDE
	- VAST
- Threat modeling should be part of dev process and threats should be ranked

- Defining the minimum security goals of our CIA triad
- OWASP ASVS
	- look more into this #todo 

## Security Assessments

		- Automated tooling to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. Generally helps with low hanging fruit
	- Penetration Tests
		- phases
			- Recon
				- Gather as Much information as Possible
			- Scanning
				- Using tools like fuzzers and vuln assessment tools to see if there is anything interesting to manually attack
			- Gaining Access
				- The manual attack
			- Maintaining Access
				- Eiether keep going or not based on ROE
			- Analysis and Documentation
				- The document of what happened PoC || GtFO
				- Not the first step
				- 
		- ROE - Rules of Engagement
		- Scope
	- Bug Bounty & Responsible Disclosure
		- Technical security assessment 
		- Crowdsourced
