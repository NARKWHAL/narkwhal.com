## Summary
I have decided to also add my health goals to this as well since this has basically became a journal. I absolutely crushed the training videos yesterday for the OSINT certification but I believe it is because the information got a bit repetitive and in essence it was "You got some information google dork it or look for a tool"

My goal is to finish the OSINT training tonight and possibly start the certification challenge tomorrow night.
