## Journal
Heading back into the WIndows CMD challenge Starting at 7.2.4. Most of my learning time today though has been around seeing the Crowdstrike issue causing massive outages.

## Raw Notes
### Locating Files -CMD
- ```dir /s meow.txt``` -> This will search the current directory and all of its sub directories for Meow.txt
- ```dir /s *.exe``` -> The wildcard will allow us to search the current and all sub directories for all executables
- ```dir /s *.txt /p``` -> Does similar to the one above but the ```/p``` switch makes the query stop when it fills the screen
- ```tree``` -> Will create a tree showing us all sub directories in a more digestable view.
- ```tree Directory\SubDirectory /F``` -> This will show the tree starting at ```SubDirectory``` the ```/F``` switch allows us to see all the files in the directories (maybe all might just be interesting)
- ```xfreerdp /u:itsme /v:111.111.111.111``` -> xfreerdp is a way to RDP via kali. DO not know how much I need to know about this tool but this command will be valuable to save for later.
