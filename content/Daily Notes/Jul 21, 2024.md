## Raw Notes
### Windows - CMD - Searching Text in Files
- ```find "persian" C:\Docs\cats.txt``` -> will look for the string "persian" in the cats.txt file
	- You can pipe ```find``` ie ```|```
	- Find does not support Regex
- ```findstr "Alan Pasta" text.txt``` -> this will search for all occurances of either Alan or Pasta inside of the txt doc
- ```more``` -> allows us to look at big outputs in a more user friendly method by allowing us to use arrowing to paginate through the output.

### Windows - CMD - System data
- ```systeminfo``` -> gives information around the given windows system like OS version and name
- #### User Accounts
	- *Administrator*
		- Self explanatory. Master user
	- *Normal User*
		- This is for regular users. Essentially day to day users but people that dont need Admin access
	- *Guest*
		- Short term burner accounts with limited access
	- *System*
		- Administrative level permissions for managing critical services

		- users who are permitted to log in remotely
