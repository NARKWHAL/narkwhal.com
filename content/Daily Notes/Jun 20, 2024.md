```bash
ffuf -u 'http://localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=FUZZ' -w numbers.txt -mr 'admin'
```

the command above is running fuff fuzzing the account number in the URL above.  The "-w" tag adds the wordlist we are fuzzing by and the "-mr 'admin'" is allowing us to filter results that come back with admin on the page. 

***LISTEN***
'-mr' tag is case sensitive "admin" and "Admin" will give different results see if there is a tag to remove the case sensitivity or you are going to have to do multiple scans...

#todo see if you can fuzz the '-mr' filter tag
