## Journal
Last night when doing the third problem I was very close to solving it. the methods I used were right but I did not get the solution due to the password list I used and not looking more at the changes is size of response

Fuff command from last night

```bash
ffuf -request tmp.txt -request-proto http -mode clusterbomb -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/pass5.txt:FUZZPASSWORD -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:FUZZUSERNAME -fs 3256
```

lets break down the top request into chunks to better retain and understand what it does

### Using a premade request

```bash
ffuf -request tmp.txt
```

The above is stating that we want to use a request that is defined in our tmp.txt file. An example of out tmp.txt file is below.

```
POST /labs/a0x03.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 26
Origin: http://localhost
Connection: close
Referer: http://localhost/labs/a0x03.php
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1

username=FUZZUSERNAME&password=FUZZPASSWORD
```

### Request Protocol

```bash
ffuf -request tmp.txt -request-proto http
```

the addition in the above statement is telling us to use the http protocol when running.

### Mode 

```bash
ffuf -request tmp.txt -request-proto http -mode clusterbomb
```

The addition of "-mode clusterbomb" is letting us choose to to run every password with every username. There are four modes as I am currently aware of but right now let us just focus on Cluster Bomb since that was the one used.

"Cluster Bomb lets us use multiple payload sets. There is a different payload set for each defined position. The attack iterates through each payload set in turn, so that all permutations of payload combinations are tested." - Burp suite 

Essentially with our request it is letting us go through each username and password combination to see if we get as pop.

### Variables

```bash
ffuf -request tmp.txt -request-proto http -mode clusterbomb -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/pass5.txt:FUZZPASSWORD -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:FUZZUSERNAME
```

With the addition of the "-w" tag we are telling Fuff that we want to use the wordlist in the path. the addition of ":FUZZPASSWORD" and ":FUZZUSERNAME" are telling Fuff that we want to use FUZZPASSWORD and FUZZUSERNAME as the variables inside of tmp.txt and we want them to be the variables to the lists that they are attached too by the colon *hehe*

### Filter

```bash
ffuf -request tmp.txt -request-proto http -mode clusterbomb -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/pass5.txt:FUZZPASSWORD -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:FUZZUSERNAME -fs 3256
```

Now that we are now back to our full command that ends with "-fs 3256" the "-fs" just stands for filter size and we are filtering by a common return size of 3256 to see what returns have a different size. 

***LISTEN***
When I was doing the demo I tried filtering by other methods then return size and got no results. I think this is what tripped me up. Just sort by size
