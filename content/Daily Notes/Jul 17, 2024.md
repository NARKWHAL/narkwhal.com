## Journal
Still working on OSCC certification. Currently working on Linux and everything I have learned so far has been information I already know. 

## Raw Notes
- ### Linux Basics
- This site looks useful
	- https://linuxize.com/
- /etc/sudoers 
	- list of users that have access to use sudo
	- /etc/sudoers.d 
		- Is the recommended way to add more configuration data
- ```sudo -l``` or ```sudo -list```
	- Will list all the allowed commands when the user uses sudo
- ```sudo -i``` 
	- logs you into the root user
- ```id``` 
	- Will show you the current user id, group id, and groups they are in
- On a lot of Linux distros the # symbol in a terminal usually marks an escalated user
	- ```root@kali:/home/kali# ``` -> Escalated user
	- ```kali@kali:~$``` -> regular user
- ```sudo su```
	- Also allows us to login to root with our sudo password
	- Just su would require us to know the root password
- Directory vs file permissions in Linux
	- Read Write and Execute are fairly straight forward for files. They are exactly what I think of when I think of permissions however folders operate differently
	- Read Access - Gives the permission to see or list a directories contents.
	- Write Access - Allows the Creation and Deletion of files
	- Execute Access - Gives the ability to go in and traverse threw the directory
- ### WINDOWS BASICS
	- Windows files are not case sensitive
	- Windows like backslashes over /
	- Windows has Registry instead of etc configs
	- Windows is GUI > CLI
