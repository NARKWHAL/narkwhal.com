## Summary
Today and last night I fought with Virtual Box to the extent that I did not get to do any learning for the PJWT but now I feel fairly competent in troubleshooting Virtual box. Which I think is a win in itself.

What was happening was that after I would Login it would freeze. After looking at the logs it said it had something to do with the UI. Some late night insanity of wondering why restarting it didn't work. Doing a fresh reinstall was not any better, it would work but would go back to broken after the first login.

After attempting to reinstall multiple times wondering if the update and upgrade commands were causing it due to compatibility and trying to see if not running those command made it better I realized it was 2am and I needed to go to bed.

With fresh eyes the next morning before work I remembered the UI log message I saw, realized nothing I was trying to troubleshoot was a UI fix. I then noticed Kali was starting on full screen mode and when it worked it booted on scaled mode. I switched that configuration and it worked.

Yay
