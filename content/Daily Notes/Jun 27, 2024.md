## Journal

Today I am going to be taking a step back and focusing on Authentication by going back through the TCM's and Portswigger's training and filling out the [[Authentication]] section of my digital garden.

Need to complete the first three labs on Portswigger

Labs

- [ ] [Vulnerabilities in password-based logging](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based)
- [ ] [Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor) 
- [ ] [Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/other-mechanisms)

If I can get those three labs done I would consider it a productive day in learning.
