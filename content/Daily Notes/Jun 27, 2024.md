## Journal

Today I am going to be taking a step back and focusing on Authentication by going back through the TCM's and Portswigger's training and filling out the [[Authentication]] section of my digital garden.

Need to complete the first three labs on Portswigger

Labs

- [x] [Vulnerabilities in password-based logging](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based)
- [ ] [Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor) 
- [ ] [Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/other-mechanisms)

If I can get those three labs done I would consider it a productive day in learning.
## Raw Notes
- Vulnerabilities in password-based logging
	- ***LISTEN***  
		- Check a log in manually first instead of doing a cluster bomb. Case is this scenario:

		- Seeing that we have an Invalid username tells us that we can snipe a Username instead of doing a cluster bomb of 10,000+ combos. Find the username first then hit it against all passwords.
