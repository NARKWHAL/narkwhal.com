### Hashing
- MD5 is not considered secure
- Gtkhash is a tool that comes with Kali that can check hashes
- ```sha256sum cat1.txt cat2.txt > cats.sha256``` -> WIll place the hashed contents of cat1.txt and cat2.txt into cats.sha256
	- ```cat cats.sha256``` -> Will print and show us the hashes
	- ```sha256sum -c cats.sha256``` -> if you send cat1.txt and cat2.txt someone you can also send cats.sha256 and run this command to make sure that the data is intact.
- Rainbow Bridging:
	- Takes the hashed password we have and compares it to a database of well known hashed passwords to see if its already on a list.
	- Crackstation.net is a rainbow bridging tool.
	- ```john``` is a cli tool that comes with Kali that can do this for us.
		- ```john hashlist.hash```
