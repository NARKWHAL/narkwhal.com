## Journal

Today is officially the first Sunday that I am going to go over all of my notes from this week and organize them into coherent thoughts and place them in their respective areas. The new sections of this week are Grafana and Node.js. I will probably make a programming directory with programming languages and make a sub directory for Node.js in a Javascript directory. 

Probably do something similar with Observability.

Today I am kicking off learning Node.js while also trying to implement Grafana into the mix.
